I'm a German software developer and currently working at [Jimdo](http://www.jimdo.de/)

On this blog I will write about anything related to coding. I have a deep interest for dynamic languages such as Ruby or PHP but I'm also interested in anything about processes and methodologies, e.g. Agile Development.  
I'm no strict follower of any of these agile methodologies, I consider those processes as a toolbox whose tools I'll make use of as the situation requires.

[Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) is a site I visit regularly, so I guess its content also mirrors my interests quite nicely.
